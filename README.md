 ### Document Manager [竊余(https://github.com/joaodrduarte/Tutorials/tree/main/Code%20Java/DocumentManager) 
  #### Creator Description
  >Learn to implement file upload to database and file download from database functionalities for a Spring Boot application which makes uses of Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap and MySQL database.

 >I will guide you through the process of developing a Spring Boot web application that allows the users to choose a file to be uploaded. Then the application will store the file into the database. The users will also see the most recently uploaded files, and they can click on a file to download from the database onto their computers.

 >You will learn to code these 3 main functions:
  > - Upload a file to the database.
  > - List uploaded files so the users can see and download.
  > - Download a file from the database.

   ### Product REST [竊余(https://github.com/joaodrduarte/Tutorials/tree/main/Code%20Java/ProductREST) 
  #### Creator Description
  > In this Spring Boot tutorial, you will learn how to develop RESTful web services APIs for CRUD operations on a MySQL database. The CRUD operations include Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete.

 > By completing this tutorial, you will be able to build a Spring Boot-based web application that exposes RESTful CRUD APIs to clients. The following technologies will be used:
   > - Spring Boot: greatly simplifies Java enterprise application and RESTful APIs development by providing default configuration and best practices.
   > - Spring Data JPA: simplifies programming for the data access layer by implementing most common persistence operations following best practices.
   > - Hibernate: is the default Object/Relational Mapping framework integrated with Spring Data JPA.

 > To follow this tutorial, you must have the following software programs installed on your computer:
   > - Java Development Kit (JDK 1.8 or newer)
   > - MySQL Database server (including MySQL Workbench and MySQL Command Line Client to manage database)
   > - A Java IDE (Eclipse IDE, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA)
   > - curl (to test RESTful APIs)

   ### Register and Login App [竊余(https://github.com/joaodrduarte/Tutorials/tree/main/Code%20Java/RegisterAndLoginApp) 
  #### Creator Description
  > Learn to develop registration (sign up) and login (sign in) functions for a Spring Boot web application with MySQL database, Bootstrap and HTML 5.
 > A user will be able to register a new account and then use this account to log into the application.

 > So I will walk you through the coding process of a Java project using the following technologies:
   > - Spring Web MVC for web application
   > - Spring Data JPA & Hibernate for Data Access layer
   > - Spring Security for Authentication (Login and Logout)
   > - Thymeleaf as template engine
   > - Bootstrap (using Webjars) for responsive UI with HTML5 and CSS
   > - JUnit Jupiter for unit testing & AssertJ for fluent assertion API
   > - MySQL database server to store user information

 > Software programs:
   > - Java Development Kit (JDK)
   > - Spring Tool Suite IDE (STS)
   > - MySQL database server & MySQL Workbench
